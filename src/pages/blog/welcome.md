# Welcome to my website!

This website will be home to my blog and personal projects, such as for documentations and previews.
Additionally, I want to dedicate my blog to interesting topics and announcements about upcoming
projects of my own.

## How it started

I've recently struggled to get into web development after failing in creating a search page for
[Fancade](https://fancade.com) games. But after being inspired by
[Linerly's blog](https://linerly.xyz/en/blog), I have finally decided to do the first step by
following the [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial)!

## More to come

Following this, I want to steadily improve the website, as I am adding content to it and post about
important feature additions in my blog. That will hopefully prevent me to get stuck on a project
like this again. The content of the blog should also become better over time, since I'm not used to
write long texts in English yet.
